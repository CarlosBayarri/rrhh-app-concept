# RrhhAppConcept

This project is based on the concept of interaction of a company, its departments and employees. In your company, a department can contain multiple employees, but an employee can only belong to one department.

The application reflects a CRUD under a very minimalist design with the sole purpose of reflecting said interaction. Material has been implemented for the design. The application should mainly show a list of departments and another of employees. For this purpose, from the main module, they have been divided into two modules, one for each one, which bring together three components: child, form and list.
