# RrhhAppConcept

This project is based on the concept of interaction of a company, its departments and employees. In your company, a department can contain multiple employees, but an employee can only belong to one department.

The application reflects a CRUD under a very minimalist design with the sole purpose of reflecting said interaction. Material has been implemented for the design. The application should mainly show a list of departments and another of employees. For this purpose, from the main module, they have been divided into two modules, one for each one, which bring together three components: child, form and list.

The state of the application is managed with Redux. The user reduder allow us to manage the user information from Firebase. Also we have the departments and staf reducers.

The prototype of this application is in this [PDF](https://github.com/CarlosBayarri/rrhh-app-concept/blob/master/BasicConcept.pdf).

## App startup
This application is in [GitHubPages](https://carlosbayarri.github.io/rrhh-app-concept/), [Firebase](https://rrhh-app-9601b.firebaseapp.com/) and docker. In the package.json there is some scripts to create and run the docker image: 
- docker_build
- run_docker_container

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
